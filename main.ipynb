For example, you could create a box plot to show the distribution of expression levels across different B cells, or a heatmap to show the relationship between different B cells and their expression levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, you may want to include some additional functionality in your program, such as the ability to select different subsets of the data to visualize or to interact with the plot in some way (e.g., by highlighting points or zooming in on a specific region).\n",

    "Overall, the key is to think about what you want to learn from the data and how best to visualize it in order to achieve your goals. With some careful planning and attention to detail, you should be able to create a powerful and useful program in R to help you with the visualization of differential expression of B cells.\n",
